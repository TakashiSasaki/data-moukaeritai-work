# Repository for Schemas, Taxonomies, and UUIDs

This repository serves as a central registry for various schemas, taxonomies, and UUID definitions. The goal is to provide both machine-readable and human-readable versions of these resources. The human-readable documentation is published as a GitHub Pages site from the root of this repository.

## Directory Structure

- **/schemas**: Contains machine-readable schema definitions (e.g., JSON Schema, XML Schema).
- **/taxonomies**: Contains taxonomy definitions (e.g., JSON-LD, RDF XML, plain text).
- **/uuids**: Contains definitions and information related to UUIDs used within the project or organization.
- **/examples**: Contains example files demonstrating the usage or implementation of the schemas and taxonomies.

Feel free to explore the directories and contribute by following the guidelines (to be defined).
